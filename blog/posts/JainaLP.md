This is essentially a *readme* file for an interesting and intensive projectâ€”I'm sure this is not a unique idea . The main idea of the project is to essentially outsource the role of a long/short analyst. As quant research currently stands, I think an LLM will function better at being a discretionary through a long/short analyst role rather than a quant.
