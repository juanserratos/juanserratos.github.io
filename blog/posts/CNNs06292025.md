In testing the full functionality of this writing environment, I quickly wrote up this *formualic* derivation of the Black-Scholes model which I'll decide to keep here.


## Introduction


The Black-Scholes-Merton model, often just shortened to *Black-Scholes*, aims to give the fair price of a European call option given the dynamic movement of the underlying stock. The overarching idea is to construct a PDE that must under no-arbitrage, and then use the structure/assumptions of the option to solve the PDE. Really nicely, the same PDE that describes the diffusion of heat is the same  PDE that describes the evolution of the no-arbitrage portfolio. Because of this, the derivation from 
$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0,
$$ where $V_T = (S_T - K)^+ $, $\lim_{S \to \infty} V_t = S- K$, and $V_t|_{S = 0} =0$, 
to Black-Scholes 
$$
V_t = \Phi (d_1) S_t - \Phi (d_2) Ke^{-r(T-t)},
$$
where
$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln(\frac{S_t}{K}) + (r+\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) (T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}
$$
$$
d_2 = \frac{\ln(\frac{S_t}{K}) + (r-\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) (T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}} = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T-t}
$$ a bit more straightfoward. 


### Setup

So we want to price an option whose value at time $t$ is $V_t$. The option determined by the expiration date, $T$, a strike price $K$, and underlying stock whose price at time $t$ is $S_t$. The option is then defined by its payoff at expiry, $V_T = \max (S_T - K, 0) := (S_T- K)^+$. Note that we're setting this up for call options, but put options will follow almost exact same logic.
