This repository contains the source for my personal website. It is a simple
static site served directly from the files in this repository. To view the
pages locally, open `index.html` in your browser.

The site features an animated **Langton's ant** simulation that occupies an
L-shaped region along the right and bottom edges of the page. Use the toggle in
the bottom left corner to switch between light and dark mode. The animation
updates its colors automatically when the theme changes.

No build step is required; just modify the HTML or CSS and commit the changes.
